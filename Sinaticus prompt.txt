and then begin to plan the implementation of this app, I then want you to build the 
  app all the text needed is availble in @Codex\ Sinaiticus\ New\ Testiment\ English\ written\ 330-350\ 
  translated\ 1861.pdf and @The\ King\ James\ Version\ of\ the\ Bible.txt remember to use only the books in 
  the codex and recall that we want to have links to complete scriptures where possible. thirdly we will not 
  be using any images from the original manuscript and any other Copyright violating items will be left out. I
   will provide logos for the app and I will provide any other images you want just be sure to specify them as
   I will be generating them with AI. Please enjoy the process and remember most important the app will be 
  made to be available on web and android for now so build it with that in mind but move one step at a time. 
  THank you
